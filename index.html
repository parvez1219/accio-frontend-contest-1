    <p>
        The <b><i>Beagle</i></b> is a breed of small hound that is similar in appearance to
        the much larger foxhound. The <b><i>Beagle</i></b> is a scent hound, developed
        primarily for hunting hare (beagling). Possessing a great sense of
        smell and superior tracking instincts, the <b><i>beagle</i></b> is the primary breed
        used as detection dogs for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs
        in quarantine around the world.
